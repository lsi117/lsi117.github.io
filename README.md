myWebsite
I have included some pages of my current website : laureninacio.com

I created this by using a single template and then connecting all pages to the template(using PHP). Although I really like the look of my current website I want to change it to something much more minimalistic and therefore need to expand my knowledge further on CSS(especially!!!!).

I have some references for what I want my new site to look like...https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/web-design/websites-big-background-images/
