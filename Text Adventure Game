Project One: Game Proposal

Name of Game: Haunted Woodland Adventure —A Text Adventure Game— https://git.generalassemb.ly/laureni/ProjectOneGame/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-06%20at%2012.06.40%20PM.png

Brief Description of Game: This game will be a text-adventure game. Sorta like an RPG adventure through a very haunted forest. Choices made will influence the rest of the gameplay. I really wanted to make this game because I really like to play RPG based games. I love getting immersed into the story.

Initial Thoughts On Game Structure: IDEAS: Going to be based on If and else statements. Buttons will have consequences and influence the rest of the story. Choices are important. I think that I will either use switch statements or if,else if , and else conditionals. Also, I will be experimenting with animations and see what I can do with them to make my game have a certain look, (btns: will fade in, possibly). Also, I might consider haveing the player/user having to type into an input box in order to trigger events while in the forest.

CHALLENGES: Some challenges I think I will run into is limited time. I think with the limited time that it will hinder the actual story that I will have to come up with in order to make this text adventure rich in detail and also immersive to really succeed. I also think that I will try to use as much JS as I can just to practice, but in the range I feel comfortable.

Phases of Completion: Step 1= Structuring out the HTML. I think that the first thing I will have to do is build an environment from the CSS. I think I will have a few buttons that you can press and then the page fades out into another set of choices. A simple design will do, black background and text that is kinda spooky. I can add some colorful stuff with font awesome.

Step 2 = In this step I think that I will have to plan out what I want the javascript to do. I think that I will use jQuery for some of the animations and in general when creating this. With the JS I will more than likely be going over some examples I’ve seen in codepen and other sites(which I list in the resources.)
